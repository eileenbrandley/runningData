## Southern Road Relays 2019

How do you win the Southern Road Relays. I decided to visualise the road relays leg times by teams so we can try and 
infere what it takes to win the road relays.

The data from these plots are kindly taken from [here](http://www.mkac.org.uk/static/19seaarelay/19seaaheader.htm). The 
plot below compares leg times for all competing teams. Long and short legs are displayed separately, and can be toggled between, 
hovering over a point should show a little more detail about the leg.


  <div>
    <label for="switchLeg">
      Long Legs? <input type="checkbox" id="switchLeg" checked="True">
      <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
    </label>
  </div>
  
  
 

<div id="chart_div" style="height: 1000px; width: 100%; margin-top: 0; position: absolute; left: 10px">
