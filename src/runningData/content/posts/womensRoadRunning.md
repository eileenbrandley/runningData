## Who runs the world? 
Are we getting faster? I didn't actually do any analysis but instead just plotted the times of the fastest performances 
by year and the average time... but from that we can try and infer if we are getting faster :). I'll update the current 
year results in a bit as we are still a bit early in the season so the results are noisy.
