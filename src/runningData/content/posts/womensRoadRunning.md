## Who runs the world? 
Are we getting faster? I didn't actually do any analysis but instead just plotted the times of the fastest performances 
by year and the average time... but from that we can try and infer if we are getting faster :). I'll update the current 
year results in a bit as we are still a bit early in the season so the results are noisy.

The girls are getting faster! It looks like the average times of the fastest distance runners is dropping, from 
~2:47 average in 2010 to sub 2:45 in 2017 and 2018 for the marathon, from high 34minutes to low 34mins for the 10km 
and from 17mins to 16:30mins in the 5000m (when we consider the top 250 athletes).
