### What happened in the league overall?

Season total scores and positions for historic Surrey league seasons. There are some intense finishes in here... the 
2019 Senior Women battle between Herne Hill and Thames Hare and Hounds is close. But not as close as the 2017/18 Men's
season between H/W and Kent AC.
