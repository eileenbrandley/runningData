## A brief sciencing of Surrey League (div 1) data:
I have had a go at making some funky plots from data from the last few Surrey League years (the data I have starts at 
the 2014/15 season). The plots are made from data from the wonderful [Surrey League website](https://surreyleague.org/) and 
the google charts API (not mobile browser friendly, sorry!).

### Season Points
There have been some tasty team battles over the years of the surrey league... the 2019 Senior Women battle between 
Herne Hill and Thames Hare and Hounds was close and came down to the final match. But not as close as the 2017/18 Men's
season between H/W and Kent AC.

### Surrey League Royalty
Who are the queen and king of the Surrey League? We can see which runners have had the most top 10 finishes (or top x 
finishes, use the slider!) in the Surrey League:
