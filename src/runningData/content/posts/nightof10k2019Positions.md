## Positions of athletes throughout the race
Trying to show athlete's positions at each km split throughout the race. The colours at each node don't currently mean
anything but I am working on that. Also some athletes were missing a lot of splits so their races are not in the visualisations, sorry!

Kind of fun to see the change in race positions throughout the race too. If you are interested in lap times for the race, you can find that [here]({{< ref "nightof10k2019.md" >}})
