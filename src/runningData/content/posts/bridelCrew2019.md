## git commit -am 'Another Bridle Run'
Little visualisation of the the number of times and miles I have ran on the Bridle path this year. For this analysis 
the bridle path is counted as only the Bridle Path around the reservoir and not the bit from 86th to Columbus circle. 
Maybe this is wrong, I will wait for some real bridle path New Yorkers to correct me.
