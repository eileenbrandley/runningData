## git commit -am 'Another Bridle Run'
Little visualisation (modelled - stolen - from github) of the the number of times and miles I have ran on the Bridle path this year. For this analysis 
the bridle path is counted as only the [Bridle Path around the reservoir](#fwiw-this-is-the-bridle) and not the bit from 86th to Columbus circle. 
Maybe this is wrong, I will wait for some real bridle path New Yorkers to correct me.

### FWIW this is the bridle
It is the bridle path around the res. It is great.
