      <description>Southern Road Relays 2019 I was interested to see the finishing times of runners from the road-relays. Do winning have one superstar who is smashing it who pulls the average time down or are the winning teams just made up of a solid group of runners. Or a bit of both.
The data from these plots are kindly taken from here. The plot below compares leg times for all competing teams.</description>
